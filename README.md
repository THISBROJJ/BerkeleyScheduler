## Project Name
BerkeleyScheduler

## Application Description
BerkeleyScheduler is a comprehensive academic planning tool designed for UC Berkeley students. The platform allows users to create and share both academic and custom schedules, access real-time reviews for professors and courses, and join class-specific group chats for peer collaboration. An integrated GPA calculator computes cumulative GPA and total earned credits based on user-inputted grades and course units.
