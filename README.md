Team: Ankita Biyani, Yunji Seo, Liana Zhang

## Project Name
BerkeleyScheduler

## Application Description
BerkeleyScheduler is a comprehensive academic planning tool designed for UC Berkeley students. The platform allows users to create and share both academic and custom schedules, access real-time reviews for professors and courses, and join class-specific group chats for peer collaboration. An integrated GPA calculator computes cumulative GPA and total earned credits based on user-inputted grades and course units.

Sure! Here's the English explanation for the **"What Should I Wear Today?" â€“ Weather-Based Outfit Recommender App**:

## ðŸ‘— **"What Should I Wear Today?" â€“ Weather-Based Outfit Recommender**

### ðŸ’¡ **Project Idea Summary**
This is a web application that recommends daily outfits based on **real-time weather data** and **user preferences**. It's both fun and practical, and a great way to showcase creative frontend design with meaningful API integration.

---

### ðŸ”Œ **APIs to Use**
- **[OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api)**: for real-time weather, temperature, humidity, and precipitation data
- **Custom clothing database**: you can create your own or allow users to build a personal "closet" (optional Firebase or MongoDB)

---

### ðŸŒŸ **Core Features**
1. **Outfit Recommendations Based on Weather**
   - Pull current weather data using the OpenWeatherMap API
   - Suggest clothing based on:
     - Temperature (e.g., wear a coat if below 10Â°C)
     - Precipitation (e.g., suggest an umbrella or waterproof shoes)
     - Wind, humidity, or UV index (optional)

2. **Location-Based Auto Weather Detection**
   - Use browser geolocation to fetch weather for the userâ€™s location

3. **Seasonal Styling Modes**
   - Let users switch between summer and winter wardrobes
   - Adjust styling logic accordingly

4. **Personal Closet System (Optional)**
   - Users can upload their clothes (with tags like "jacket", "light sweater", "boots")
   - App selects from user-uploaded items that match the weather

---

### ðŸŽ¨ **Bonus UI Ideas**
- Cute illustrated avatars that change clothes based on the weather
- Animated weather effects in the background
- Outfit history log (see what you wore last week!)

---

### ðŸ‘¥ **Team Roles (If You Have a Team)**
| Role | Task |
|------|------|
| Frontend Dev | UI, clothing display, interactivity |
| Backend Dev | Closet database, logic for recommendations |
| API Integration | Weather API, geolocation |
| UX/UI Designer | Illustrations, avatar customization (optional) |
